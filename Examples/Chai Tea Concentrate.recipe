- Cinnamon | 2-3 Sticks | 
- Cloves | 8-10 | 
- Peppercorns | 5-10 | 
- Cardamom | 7-10 Pods | 
- Ginger | 1 slice fresh | 
- Sugar | 2 Tbsp | Heaping
- Tea | Black, 1 Tbsp | 

> It’s easiest to remove the tea later if the tea sits inside of its own steeping container.

- Water | 2 Cups | 

> Optional spices to add: nutmeg or vanilla bean.

Add ingredients to a pot with a lid.

Raise to a boil quickly on high, 4 minutes [Raise to a Boil].

Simmer for 5 minutes [Simmering] on medium to low heat.

Remove from heat and steep tea with spices for 5 minutes [Steeping Tea].

Remove the tea from the pot (either with a strainer, or removing the pod tea is stored in) and let pot sit for 15 minutes [Infusing Spices] with spices.

Strain out the spices and pour the concentrate into a jar to store.

- Honey | 1 Tbsp | 

You can add some honey to taste. I usually add one or two spoonfuls to the mixture. Start with one and add more to taste.

> Experiment with the ratio of spices. I find that I like it heavier on cloves and cinnamon. A little ginger goes a long way.
