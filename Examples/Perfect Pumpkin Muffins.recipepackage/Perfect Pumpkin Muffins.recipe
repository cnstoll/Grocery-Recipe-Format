## Wet Ingredients

- Sugar | 3/4 Cup (white/brown) | 
- Vegatable Oil | 1/4 Cup | 

> Apple Sauce also works great if that's an option.

- Eggs | 2 | 

Mix sugar, oil, eggs in a large bowl.

- Pumpkin | 3/4 Cup | 

> I usually try to add extra pumpkin, up to a whole can.

- Water | 1/4 cup | 
- Yogurt | 1/4 Cup, Coconut Milk | 

> Adding yogurt helps to moisten the muffins and bind the gluten free ingredients together.

Add remaining wet ingredients to bowl and continue mixing.

## Dry Ingredients

- Pancake Mix | 1.5 Cup, Gluten Free | 
- Baking Powder | 1/4 Tsp | 
- Baking Soda | 1/4 Tsp | 
- Salt | 1/4 - 1/2 Tsp | 
- Cloves | 1/4 - 1/2 Tsp | 
- Cinnamon | 1/2 - 1 Tsp | 
- Nutmeg | 1/4 - 1/2 Tsp | 

Sift together dry ingredients in a separate bowl.

## Muffins

Add dry ingredients to the wet mixture and continue mixing until fully combined.

- Chocolate Chips | 1/2 Cup | 

> I usually add a full cup.

Stir in chocolate chips.

Preheat oven to 400 F and grease two normal size muffin tins.

Fill two normal size greased muffin tins and bake for 25 minutes [Baking] or until ready.

> Muffins should not appear wet coming out of the oven. If they are, they probably need more time. It’s possible the muffins could finish cooking in as little as twenty minutes, but undercooked muffins usually aren’t as good as just slightly over cooked ones. To be safe, start watching the oven after about twenty minutes.
